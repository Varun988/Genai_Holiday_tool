In this project we upload the Holiday list pdf file and when we prompt for any question related to holiday,it will give the answer related to it.
For example if you ask 'How many holiday in Septmenber month?'
You can run the jupyter notbook to generate the pickle file and then run app.py which is a streamlit application.
